        The title, along with the flavor text, hint towards using the pig pen cypher (also known as the freemason cipher) to decode the symbols, with animals standing in for dots.
      </p>

      <p>
        If we try to decode them going clockwise starting from the top left, we get the following string:
      </p>

      <center>
        <p>
          WHIAGTIST NDEAQPGEP GEEIUBJAV EXEHHHCHI
        </p>
      </center>

      <p>
        Which doesn't quite look right. The first thing to notice is that the animal heads rotate as we go along the edge, indicating that we should re-orient the image when we turn to a new side. Interpreting the symbols in this way (which leaves the top row unchanged) gives:
      </p>

      <center>
        <p>
          WHIAGTIST NHEPORINR CEEATHRIS EWEDDDING
        </p>
      </center>

      <p>
        This still doesn't look quite right, although we have a lot less Q's and X's which seems promising. If we read the letters corresponding only to the red fish, they spell out:
      </p>

      <center>
        <p>
          IGNORE RED
        </p>
      </center>

      <p>
        Telling us that we should ignore the red herrings that have been leading us astray! The remaining letters spell out:
      </p>

      <center>
        <p>
          WHAT IS THE PRINCE AT HIS WEDDING
        </p> 
      </center>

      <p>
        The enumeration tells us the final answer is a 3 and a 5 letter word, and the phrase which fits the clue is THE GROOM, our final answer.
      </p>
